**Code out Violence** was created by the [University of Chicago Crime Lab](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/labs/crime) to bring together civilian crime analysts from police agencies across the country-and even the world-for three days of disruptive innovation and collaborative problem-solving. Recognizing the toll of violent crime and illegal firearm use in communities across the country, Code out Violence will spotlight actionable solutions to gun violence.

### *Datathon Topic Sheet*

Below is a list of example topics to explore while at Code out Violence. This is by no means an exclusive list of the types of projects you should be working on, but rather a guide in case your team is looking for ideas to pursue.

**Prompts**:
1.	Create a new ‘index’ to measure crime activity and use it to compare different cities.
•	Look for ways to compare data across jurisdictions that could lead to useful insights for law enforcement.
•	Use advanced spatial analysis as a part of your index
2.	Use the NarrativeScience Tableau extension to present crime analysis in a more digestible and nuanced format.
3.	Use Tableau or Insights for ArcGIS to build an interactive dashboard which replaces old or automated reports, reimagines an analysis product and/or innovates more traditional police agency visuals.
4.	Use geofencing to select and filter crime data.
5.	Combine open source datasets with scraped narrative data from newspapers or other sources to build a more comprehensive understanding of a public safety concern.

**Topics of Study**:
1.	Gun violence
2.	Hate crime
3.	Inter/Intra-jurisdictional crime trends

### Datasets
