October 25th through 27th, Chicago IL

**Code out Violence** was created by the [University of Chicago Crime Lab](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/labs/crime) to bring together civilian crime analysts from police agencies across the country-and even the world-for three days of disruptive innovation and collaborative problem-solving. Recognizing the toll of violent crime and illegal firearm use in communities across the country, Code out Violence will spotlight actionable solutions to gun violence.
